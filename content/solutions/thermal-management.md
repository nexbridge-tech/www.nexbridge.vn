summary: "Recover real thermal margin from junction to facility by connecting losses, interfaces, coolant or airflow and production variation."
pain_points:
  - "Prototype temperatures pass while production units show a wide hotspot distribution."
  - "Power derating appears only after hot soak, fouling, aging or back-to-back duty cycles."
  - "Changing TIM or increasing airflow moves the hotspot but does not recover system margin."
  - "Pump, fan or cold-plate specifications exist without a correlated thermal model."
interventions:
  - title: "Loss-to-temperature correlation"
    description: "Connect electrical loss maps to junction estimates, sensors and measured boundary conditions."
  - title: "Interface & tolerance analysis"
    description: "Quantify bond-line, flatness, pressure, contact resistance and production distributions."
  - title: "Cooling architecture review"
    description: "Assess flow balance, pressure drop, air recirculation, transient capacity and degraded operation."

    description: "Build corner cases and instrumentation that prove margin across duty cycle, ambient and aging."

Thermal problems in power electronics rarely originate at the scale they're discovered at. A field failure that shows up as a facility-level heat problem often traces back to a component-level thermal interface decision made years earlier; a component that overheats on a production line often traces back to an enclosure-level airflow assumption nobody validated at the system level. Treating thermal management as one discipline across every scale — component, pack, enclosure, facility — is what catches these before they compound.

## Component-level thermal design

At the component level, the work is choosing and validating the thermal interface — gap pads, thermal grease, phase-change materials — against the actual mounting pressure, bond-line tolerance and production temperature range the application will see, not the datasheet's idealized test condition. For power modules in traction inverters and battery packs, this means cold-plate design sized to the module's real switching losses and duty cycle, not a generic thermal budget carried over from a previous program.

## System and enclosure cooling

At the system level, liquid cooling loops for containerized ESS and cold-plate networks for multi-module power electronics assemblies have to be designed against the enclosure's actual airflow, ambient temperature range and maintenance access constraints — not validated in isolation and then dropped into a container design after the fact. A cooling loop that performs well on a bench, tested in a controlled lab environment, can still be undersized once it's handling a container's real thermal load in a real climate.

## Facility-level heat reduction

At the facility level, radiative cooling coatings and building-envelope thermal design address the heat load a manufacturing facility or data center generates before it ever reaches component-level cooling systems — reducing the baseline thermal burden that every downstream cooling system, from HVAC to liquid loops, otherwise has to absorb. It's the thermal engineering equivalent of fixing the problem upstream instead of over-engineering every system downstream to compensate for it.
